This is a extended SPI PMOD board and holds a [1.8 inch SPI TFT screen with SD-card](http://www.lcdwiki.com/1.8inch_SPI_Module_ST7735S_SKU:MSP1804).

When not working with the ST7735S driver, try the S6D02A1 driver. It seems that the S6D02A1 was used on older 1.8 TFT modules (with blue tab).

*Status*: soldered, unkown if working.

Note: lay down C1 (if top hits TFT module when mounting upright).

My [Kicad library](https://github.com/atoomnetmarc/ATOOMNETKICAD) is used in this project.
